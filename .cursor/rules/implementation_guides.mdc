# Implementation Guide Reference

- **Always Check Implementation Guides First**
  - Before starting work on any task or subtask, check if an implementation guide exists in the `docs/implementation-guides/` directory
  - Implementation guides provide critical context, requirements, and integration points needed for proper implementation
  - Example: For Task 6, refer to `docs/implementation-guides/task-6-transcription-worker.md`

- **Implementation Guide Structure**
  - Each guide is organized by subtasks with specific implementation points
  - The **Integration Points** section shows connections to other system components
  - Some guides reference additional technical specifications in the `docs/specifications/` directory

- **Usage in Task Implementation**
  - Follow the implementation points as guiding principles for each subtask
  - Pay special attention to integration points when connecting different components
  - Ensure your implementation aligns with the specified patterns and approaches

- **Missing Implementation Guides**
  - If an implementation guide doesn't exist for a task you're working on:
    1. Check if there's a technical specification in `docs/specifications/`
    2. Consider creating an implementation guide before starting work
    3. At minimum, document your implementation approach before coding

- **Guide Format Reference**
  ```markdown
  # Task X: Component Name - Implementation Guide
  
  ## Subtask X.1: Feature Name
  - **Implementation Point**: Detailed explanation
  - **Another Point**: More implementation details
  ...
  
  ## Integration Points
  - Connections to other system components
  ```
- **When Updating Implementation**
  - Review the implementation guide before making changes
  - Update the guide if your implementation deviates from the original plan
  - Document reasons for significant implementation changes
