## ðŸš¨ Security Audit Failure

The automated security audit workflow has detected potential security vulnerabilities in the project dependencies.

### Details

- **Workflow Run**: [Security Audit Workflow Run]({{ env.GITHUB_SERVER_URL }}/{{ env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY }}/actions/runs/{{ env.GITHUB_RUN_ID }})
- **Detected On**: {{ date | date('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss') }}
- **Branch/PR**: {{ env.GITHUB_REF }}

### Required Actions

Please review the workflow logs for specific details about the vulnerabilities and take the following actions:

1. Review the audit report in the workflow logs
2. Update affected dependencies to secure versions
3. Run a local security audit to confirm the issues are resolved
4. If vulnerabilities cannot be fixed immediately, assess the risk and create a mitigation plan

### Security Guidelines

When addressing these vulnerabilities:

- Prioritize critical and high-severity issues
- Test thoroughly after updating dependencies
- Document any intentional exceptions with justification
- Consider implementing additional security measures if dependencies cannot be updated
